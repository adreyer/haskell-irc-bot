This is an IRC Bot that I'm writing in an attempt to learn Haskell better.

It is, in many ways, a framework for writing IRC bots as much as it is a bot.

It is a work in progress.  Parts of the protocol are missing or unimplemented.
Some things in the API are missing or broken.  Nothing is documented.

Enjoy.

Thanks,
Rev. Johnny Healey
